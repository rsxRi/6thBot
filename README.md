# 6thBot

You'll need to grab a Discord API token and replace the "discord" dictionary element in `api_keys.json` with it.
If you want to test/add to the other APIs, you'll need a token for them too.

Making a new module? Make sure to add `bot.load_extension(fileName)` at the end of `main.py` after you're done.
